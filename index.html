              <p>Marcus currently works at Spotify, where he leads the Partners &amp; Emerging Platforms engineering function, as a Tribe Lead.

              <p>During his career, Marcus has worked as an engineer, a product manager and engineering leader and manager. He thrives in hard working, solid groups and loves building people as much as he loves building product. Shipping excites him, as the process of creating something where there was nothing is a bit like playing god. 

              <p>Marcus does not enjoy writing about himself in third person, but thought it would seem fitting here.

          <h2>The stuff I've been part of as a tribe lead at Spotify</h2>
          <p>During the last few years, as I've been running the Partners Tribe
          at Spotify, I've been part of a world class team. With the risk of not sounding 
          humble, what we achieve together awe me every day. Hopefully our biggest victories
          are still ahead, but I wanted to highlight some stuff that the team has done over
          the last few years, and that I have hopefully played some small part in.
          <ul>
            <li><span class="subhead-strong">Shipped world class product</span> &middot; 
              In the last two years, the team has shipped Spotify for <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/30/sony-spotify-playstation-music-streaming">Playstation</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/10/22/chromecast-first-gen-spotify-support/">Chromecast</a>, <a href="http://www.androidcentral.com/spotifys-smooth-streaming-great-addition-android-auto">Android Auto</a>, <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2014/10/02/spotify-carplay/">Apple CarPlay</a> and <a href="http://blog.sonos.com/news/spotify-on-sonos-update/">Sonos</a> as well as <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/20/9005355/nike-running-adds-spotify-music">Nike+</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/08/06/shazam-add-songs-spotify-rdio-playlists/">Shazam</a>, <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/05/starbucks-spotify/">Starbucks</a> and DJ software like <a href="http://pacemaker.net/">Pacemaker</a> and <a href="https://www.algoriddim.com/djay-iphone">Djay2</a>. These products delight millions of users every day, and has brought many new users into our experience, and convinced existing users to get Premium.
            </li>
            <li><span class="subhead-strong">Shipped entire new platforms</span> &middot; In any succesful strategy aimed at ubiquity across devices, you need a layer of scalable technology, and a product experience that makes that technology easily accessible. We've successively built up our capabilities, including <a href="http://dailytekk.com/2015/04/27/the-5-best-spotify-connect-speakers-you-can-buy-now-2015/?reading=continue">Spotify Connect</a> (available on hundreds of SKU's), our <a href="http://www.xmcgraw.com/how-to-build-an-ios-spotify-app-with-a-watchkit-extension/">iOS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/spotify/android-sdk">Android</a> SDK's as well as our new <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/17/spotify-courts-developers-via-new-web-api-with-echo-nest-metadata-and-more/">Web API</a>, servicing billions of requests each month.
            </li>
            <li><span class="subhead-strong">Deprecated and killed old platforms</span> &middot; As important as building out new platforms and capabilities is tending to the legacy and making sure you pave the way for moving quickly in the future. We've worked incredibly hard on getting into a mindset of moving quickly. A few examples of though choices this lead to include <a href="https://gigaom.com/2014/11/03/spotify-kills-its-app-platform-three-years-after-its-launch/">discontinuing the apps strategy</a>, <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify/">deprecating libspotify</a>, and <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/migration-guide/">killing our old web api</a>. Neither of these were easy decision, but they freed up capacity to build the future.
            </li>
            <li><span class="subhead-strong">Grown a sustainable and happy team</span> &middot; Throughout these years, we've grown the team by close to 100%. We've grown from being based only in Stockholm to being in Stockholm, London and San Francisco. We've managed to build one of the most diverse engineering teams in Spotify. We've had close to zero attrition, with only three people from partners leaving Spotify in the last two years. Many engineers have moved from one discipline to another, or into product or management. We've of course had a few fuckups, but we're still mostly the same group growing and learning as we go.

          <h2>We enjoy travelling</h2>
          <p>If we (that is, me and my fiancee) have a dollar to spare, we're likely to spend it on travelling. In 2015 I've logged well over a 150 days on the road and a decidedly environmentally hostile amount of time in the air. If you ever want to entice me to a conference, your best bet is to be somewhere exciting. I'm just as infatuated with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/r6a70NAuI0KmI3e4E6R_FQSI3t-WVTve4KfB40/">Berlin</a> as I enjoy <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/rG0ilnAuLR0XmHqYmG9KQtcjLjfYtj9_mJVio0/">Portland</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/lYgvcAguO90eCgovPrR_RJaib022gYj8p8pLs0/">Austin</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/mnAepBAuMtzM2-D8H0-9xgxtjAfISRckX--Y00/">Osaka</a> or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Y0KfgFAuKnX2T5KQ1sWowRLcjttORzD6eHRfk0/">Istanbul</a>.</p>
          <h2>I cook, I eat and I run</h2>
          <p>I'm an amateur cook, a dedicated eater and, by necessity and interest alike, an aspiring runner. As often as you find me hacking, you're likely to find me <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/SNbP_EAuB3iQoITMbbQ1vQnm8AkV-XaC1DDMI0/">baking bread</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/wHfqMNguN3i7ObL3HLn-kvPIXEA6GVlRfvWVc0/">tempering chocolate</a> or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/t8Kmf4AuDZbbJnOYDVktH2sFjpsGmbsWqGwgI0/">chopping tartare</a>. It tends to be <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/RhdVNvguAa9LtVcopzdpIIL_Iw_RntlA39Xe80/">asian</a>, but might just as well be a futile attempt at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/3ozk99AuH1BvQ8_Drw8inRwIdSkRQS56X7qE80/">pasta</a>.
            <p>If you ever want to get very nerdy
            about fine dining, I am game for that. Some of my favorite dinners ever, as seen through the eyes of my fiancée, has been <a href="http://www.owhynie.com/2015/08/momofuku-ko.html">Momofuku Ko</a> and <a href="http://www.owhynie.com/2015/05/osteria-francescana.html">Osteria Francescana</a>. But to be honest, I'll just as well enjoy a sweaty Döner at four in the morning.</p>
          <p>I am still getting into this whole running thing, but in 2015 I finished <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/7iaK9cAuPdOAzfOLq8jYBp0irqJiTh42VZocQ0/">my first half-marathon</a>. It didn't go quick by any measure (took about 2 hours 3 minutes), but I was still somewhat proud I managed to do it.
          <h2>Music is a big part of me</h2>
          <p>Growing up in the swedish countryside, my main way to pass the few hours
            I wasn't in front of my computer was attending DIY punk concerts, or making
            flyers for them. Since then I've gone through the lifecycle from teenage punk via mid-naughts hipster to a decidedly more <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/30/9416579/spotify-discover-weekly-online-music-curation-interview">Discover Weekly</a>-driven music taste.
           <p>If you want a few playlists that show you what I enjoy, my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/marcusf/playlist/5WjuwNgywlGOVzwVc6yvto">half marathon list</a>, my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/marcusf/playlist/3gp4oMYM6OuzxG0lEMXLdt">Best of 2015</a> or <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/marcusf/playlist/1YhqNZKLWmVTAtYm1jtKCJ">Best of 2014</a> might be decent tracer bullets.
