              <p>Marcus Fr&ouml;din is a software engineer, engineering leader, amateur most-things and all aroung nice person from Stockholm, Sweden.

              <p>Marcus currently works at Spotify, where he leads the Partners &amp; Emerging Platforms engineering function, as a Tribe Lead.

              <p>During his career, Marcus has worked as an engineer, a product manager and engineering leader and manager. He thrives in hard working, solid groups and loves building people as much as he loves building product. Shipping excites him, as the process of creating something where there was nothing is a bit like playing god. 

              <p>Marcus does not enjoy writing about himself in third person, but thought it would seem fitting here.

          <h2>The stuff I've been part of as a tribe lead at Spotify</h2>
          <p>During the last few years, as I've been running the Partners Tribe
          at Spotify, I've been part of a world class team. With the risk of not sounding 
          humble, what we achieve together awe me every day. Hopefully our biggest victories
          are still ahead, but I wanted to highlight some stuff that the team has done over
          the last few years, and that I have hopefully played some small part in.
          <ul>
            <li>Shipped world class product</li>
            <li>Shipped entire new platforms</li>
            <li>Deprecated and killed old platforms</li>
